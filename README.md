# Factorio crafting graph
A d3.js force-graph of the crafting tree in factorio. Nodes point from ingredient to user, and can be used to design the perfect factorio factory layout.

Each node is a link to the factorio wiki page, for easy access to more details about each item.
Root items (uncraftables) are highlighted in orange.
